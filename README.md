# alibabzo's dotfiles

Dotfiles are personal Linux configuration files.
These are mine, and they're how I've customised my system.
Feel free to copy/fork/modify/share, that's what this is all about.

# What's inside?
`atom/`: Atom configuration file

`bin/`: Added to your `$PATH`, executables that are available everywhere.

`config/`: Configuration files for applications that follow the XDG specification 

`irssi/`: Irssi IRC client theme/scripts

`vimperator/`: Vimperator for Firefox theme (I'll get around to finishing this at some point)
